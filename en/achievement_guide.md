When completing Svetlana's first quest, there is a minotaur in the central part of the dungeon in Sableby. Kill the minotaur in order to earn this achievement.

The troll lives in a cave in the north of the Old Quarry. From the entrance, move along the map to the cave where the troll lives: look for a passage to the north; move west along the upper boundary; and go south-west along a winding gorge. The entrance to the cave is at the end of the gorge.

When completing Felicia's quest, you are sent to the basement of the monastery to help prepare dinner. A ghost will burst out from a hole in the wall. If you defeat the ghost without calling for help from Mother Theodora, you will earn this acheivement.

The quest for the Queen of the Wasps can be acquired in two ways: in Sliver or in the logger camp near her; and on the second floor of the Warriors Guild (available after completing the Anastasia's quest). After going to the lumberjack camp along the path, follow the instructions of the foreman (left, then left again). When you see a wasp that is noticeably larger than the rest, kill it and earn this achievement.

The quest for the giant scorpion must be acquired on the second floor of the Warriors Guild. The scorpion lives in the Old Quarry. After climbing to a small plateau south of the huts, find and kill the scorpions. The heroines will find a clue leading to a nearby hole. Upon examining the hole, you will get two options: send one of the heroines into the hole; or to smoke all the inhabitants of the hole at once by putting a torch in it. The latter option is preferable, because even though there will be more enemies, the whole party will participate in the battle. In any case, after winning the battle you will receive the achievement.

During Felicia’s quest, you will learn about the secret cult of Abaddon in Strizhinsk and defeat it. If Diana has a sufficiently high perception, Diana will notice a switch (see screenshot below) on the island between the magic pump and the exit to the city in the Strizhinsk sewers. Pull the switch in order to reveal a nearby door. Behind the door is the room in which the Abaddon doll, a little girl turned into a vampire, is waiting. In battle, the doll summons skeletons, and upon defeat the doll transforms into a lost soul.

The quest for kikimora must be acquired on the second floor of the Warriors Guild. Go to the cemetery and talk to the grave digger.Head to the new location that appears on the global map a little to the west. Go through a tricky maze with blue magic crystals that teleport you as you approach and reach the kikimora lair. After defeating her twice, you will still be given a choice: to finish it off, or to cure it and release it. In the latter case, you lose one healing potion and receive only half of the money reward. The achievement will be earned regardless of your choice. However, in order to earn the **Goodie two-shoes** achievement, the heroines need to show mercy to the kikimora.

The Goblin lives at the very top of the Four Peaks (this location will open to you at the end of the first act). Upon arriving at the Four Peaks, move along the eastern side and at the very top you will find a staircase leading even higher. After climbing it, you will find yourself in the den of the goblin. The goblin himself is dangerous in that even before the start of the battle, he will throw a huge stone at the heroines, depriving them of some health, and often use a deafening blow in battle. You can, however, outsmart him. After locating the rope behind the tree immediately at the entrance, climb it to the top so that the goblin does not notice the heroines. Go up to the stone and push it on the head with a devil in order to start the battle with some advantage.
