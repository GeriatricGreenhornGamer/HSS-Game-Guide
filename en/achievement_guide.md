<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/heros_labours.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Hero’s labors**

When completing Svetlana's first quest, there is a minotaur in the central part of the dungeon in Sableby. Kill the minotaur in order to earn this achievement.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/every_nook_and_cave.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Every nook and cave**
The troll lives in a cave in the north of the Old Quarry. From the entrance, move along the map to the cave where the troll lives: look for a passage to the north; move west along the upper boundary; and go south-west along a winding gorge. The entrance to the cave is at the end of the gorge.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/were_afraid_of_no_ghost.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**We're afraid of no ghost!**

When completing Felicia's quest, you are sent to the basement of the monastery to help prepare dinner. A ghost will burst out from a hole in the wall. If you defeat the ghost without calling for help from Mother Theodora, you will earn this acheivement.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/annoying_bees.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Annoying bees**

The quest for the Queen of the Wasps can be acquired in two ways: in Sliver or in the logger camp near her; and on the second floor of the Warriors Guild (available after completing the Anastasia's quest). After going to the lumberjack camp along the path, follow the instructions of the foreman (left, then left again). When you see a wasp that is noticeably larger than the rest, kill it and earn this achievement.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/a_matter_of_size.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A matter of size**

The quest for the giant scorpion must be acquired on the second floor of the Warriors Guild. The scorpion lives in the Old Quarry. After climbing to a small plateau south of the huts, find and kill the scorpions. The heroines will find a clue leading to a nearby hole. Upon examining the hole, you will get two options: send one of the heroines into the hole; or to smoke all the inhabitants of the hole at once by putting a torch in it. The latter option is preferable, because even though there will be more enemies, the whole party will participate in the battle. In any case, after winning the battle you will receive the achievement.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/woeful_soul.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Woeful soul**

During Felicia’s quest, you will learn about the secret cult of Abaddon in Strizhinsk and defeat it. If Diana has a sufficiently high perception, Diana will notice a switch (see screenshot below) on the island between the magic pump and the exit to the city in the Strizhinsk sewers. Pull the switch in order to reveal a nearby door. Behind the door is the room in which the Abaddon doll, a little girl turned into a vampire, is waiting. In battle, the doll summons skeletons, and upon defeat the doll transforms into a lost soul.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/swamp_hag.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Swamp hag**

The quest for kikimora must be acquired on the second floor of the Warriors Guild. Go to the cemetery and talk to the grave digger.Head to the new location that appears on the global map a little to the west. Go through a tricky maze with blue magic crystals that teleport you as you approach and reach the kikimora lair. After defeating her twice, you will still be given a choice: to finish it off, or to cure it and release it. In the latter case, you lose one healing potion and receive only half of the money reward. The achievement will be earned regardless of your choice. However, in order to earn the **Goodie two-shoes** achievement, the heroines need to show mercy to the kikimora.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/there_prowls_a_sprite.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**There prowls a sprite ...**

The Goblin lives at the very top of the Four Peaks (this location will open to you at the end of the first act). Upon arriving at the Four Peaks, move along the eastern side and at the very top you will find a staircase leading even higher to another map. After climbing it, you will find yourself in the den of the goblin. The goblin himself is dangerous in that even before the start of the battle, he will throw a huge stone at the heroines, depriving them of some health, and often use a deafening blow in battle. You can, however, outsmart him. After locating the rope behind the tree immediately at the entrance, climb it to the top so that the goblin does not notice the heroines. Go up to the stone and push it on the head with a devil in order to start the battle with some advantage.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/glory_in_battle.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Glory in battle!**

Multistage achievement. First, wait until Felicia is level 4 or higher, grab a bottle of live ink (you can find one or after obtaining the Thieves Guild bagde purchase one for 1000 coins from the "secret wares" of the merchant in the first floor of the coffee shop) and go to the magic pump in the Stryzhinsk sewers. After deciphering the magic book located near the pump, the sorceress learns the spell "Wave". Next, you need to apply this spell in any battle, such that it backfires and hits the heroines (the probability of this sad event is 50%, so it will definitely happen on the second or third attempt). Felicia will understand that the spell needs to be improved. Next, go to the subspace of the late sorceress Larisa in Yonka, elementals live in the southeast. Approach them, and Felicia will be able to improve the spell to the version of "Wave +", which only hits enemies. A side effect of the improvement process is that a huge and very evil elemental breaks free. There is a choice. The quick and easy way is to do as Felicia advises and pull the emergency mana release lever. The difficult way is to meet the elemental in the battle and defeat it. If you want the achievement, you have to go the hard way.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/train_hard.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Train hard ...**

After completing Anastasia's quest and enrolling her in the Warriors Guild, battles in the arena will become available In order to enroll in a battle, talk to the Warriors Guild captain. There are two options - battle against monsters and battle against a team of warriors. The first monsters depend on which of the merchants you supported - it will be rats or cyclopoda. Most likely, you trample them without much difficulty. The second monster is much cooler - Cerberus. The third and last is a giant slug. It regenerates health, bites painfully and imposes poisoning immediately on the entire batch. Teams in general are easier. There are two of them. The first is four warriors. Lacking magical support and healing, they are fairly weak opponents. The second team is more diverse, there is even a priestess who heals associates. Take it out first. When you win all five battles, get this achievement.

# Legendary Equipment Achievements

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/earth_amulet.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Earth Amulet**

It is made of three amulets - one is obtained as a trophy after defeating the adventure goblins (see the **Antiheroines** achievement), the second falls from a giant spider that lives in a hole in the southeast of the goblin cave in Four Peaks, and the third is an ordinary protective amulet which you can buy or find. The blacksmith Olaf in Roadside will be happy to collect the common amulet It is made of three amulets - one is obtained as a trophy after defeating adventure goblins (see the Antiheroines achievement), the second falls from a giant spider that lives in a hole in the southeast of the goblin cave in Four Peaks, the third - an ordinary protective amulet which you can buy or find. The blacksmith Olaf in Roadside will craft this amulet for 2000 coins and 8 bottles of Rowanberry, and grant you the achievement.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/soldiers_spirit.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Soldier's spirit**

The Soul of the Soldier’s Spear is located in a lumberjack camp near Sliver. In the northern part of the location, look for the passage between the trees, leading further north. Through it you will find yourself in a secluded clearing, where, if Diana has a sufficiently high perception, you will find in the grass a skeleton of a gnome stabbed with a spear. Pick up a spear, bring it to the blacksmith Olaf in the roadside. You purchase two spheres of souls from him for 2000 coins. Go to hall of fame (1st floor, southeast) in the Warriors Guild, and absorb the aura of shovels and brooms. You return to Olaf, and he finishes work on the spear for 1000 coins and 6 bottles of Rowanberry.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/star_guardian.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Star Guardian**

Every week, except for the week of the cow and the mimic, creatures corresponding to this week appear in the Star Cave. Among them there is a star avatar - a noticeably larger and stronger version of the corresponding creature. For defeating any avatar other than chicken or the mimic, you will receive a plate. There are 7 plates in total, one from each of the avatars. You can visit the blacksmith Olaf in Roadside with any number of plates, starting with one. He will examine them and say that he can make a shield out of them. When you collect all seven, have Olaf craft the shield.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/shepherd_girls.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Shepherd Girls**

To get the shepherd’s staff, you need to wait for the cow week. Unfortunately, it is not possible to order it from the astrologer. Save before exiting from any location, go to the global map. If the new week has not begun, just play on. But if a new week has been announced when entering the global map, rejoice. The week is determined randomly at the time of exit, so reload the save until the week of the cow falls. Then go to the Star Cave, in its northern part you will find a stone slab that you can inspect. Inspect the tablet and get transported to the cow level. Navigate to the northeast corner where you see a chest guarded by two minotaurs and a portal. Kill the minotaurs, search the chest (get the staff and the achievement), through the portal you return to the real world.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/original_prankster.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Original prankster**

In Sableby, ask residents about the underground passage to the church. If you have already visited the dungeon, then talk about it with the innkeeper. Wells in the village should become active. You climb into the well in front of the village elder's house (you need a rope and 4 water breathing potions). You find yourself in a separate corner of the dungeon, which cannot be reached in any other way. If Diana’s perception is high enough, she will see an object lying in the water - a rusty magic sword. In order to get this achievement, visit the blacksmith Olaf in Roadside, and have him restore the sword for 2000 coins and 4 bottles of Rowanberry.

# Fetch/Collection Quests Achievements

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/gods_will_hear_thee.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Gods will hear thee**

In Strizhinsk convent, there is a donation box to the west of the main entrance. A one-time fee is 250 coins. Donate to the gods six times (i.e. 1,500 coins in total) - and they will respond. Svetlana will learn the Pillar of Light prayer, and you will receive an achievement.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/scrooge.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Scrooge**

The workaround is the city sewer. In one way or another, you get into the plot, so I’ll only note that you need to look for a way out of the city in the northeast corner. Free entry into the city is counted, oddly enough, not at the time of exiting the sewer into the city, but at the time of descent into the sewer through the hatch behind the city wall. Therefore, this achievement can be achieved quickly by standing in front of this hatch and going down and up as many times as needed.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/30_30_vision.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**30/30 vision**

Collect all the gifts of the Laverna - there are 9 in the first act of the game. By the way, do not forget that each gift enhances Diana’s perception, so after receiving another gift revisit previous locations to find a lot of new and useful things that you have not noticed before. Full list of the gifts and their locations:

* 4 you will find while completing the training task
* 2 in the temple at the bottom of the crevasse while completing Svetlana's second quest
* 1 in the basement of the Strizhinsk convent (Felicia's quest)
* 1 student in the Strizhinsk school will exchange it for a bottle of live ink 
* 1 is in Diana’s house in Sawdust

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/toss_a_coin_to_your_watchman.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Toss a coin to your watchman**

Pay for passing through the Stryzhinsk main gate 25 times. If it is a pity to spend money on an “honest” achievement, then accumulate 2500 coins, save the game, go through the gate the required number of times to earn the achievement, and then relaod. WARNING: If you complete the duty-free quest (see *Papers, please!* achievement) before you accumulate 25 paid passes, the achievement will become unavailable, forcing you to load an earlier save or (in the worst case) start the game again.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/pet_zoo.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Pet zoo**

Cats, dogs, horses and chickens are counted (except for chickens from Sableby). Only those animals that can be reached are taken into account, therefore, seals on the roofs, in the Thieves Guild or in the monastery are not considered. Cows from a cow level are not counted towards this achievement. An accurate list of the location of animals is being compiled. Please see the subsection regarding this achievement for further information.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/fight_another_day.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Fight another day**

Several robber gangs live on the global map - halfway from Strizhinsk to the roadside, near Sobolka and near Yonki. Diana’s thief’s vision allows you to notice an ambush in advance and avoid the confrontation, which is extremely useful at the beginning of the game since the robbers are quite strong. Avoid the ambush 10 times and earn this achievement. You can just walk the right number of times back and forth along the road.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/knowledge_is_power.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Knowledge is power**

You can immediately collect all 16 books and submit them. Alternatively, you can first collect and submit the required 15, and bring the remaining one later. The achievement will unlock when 16 books are at the teacher's place in Sliver.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/achievement_guide/stubs/cleanliness_is_godliness.jpg" width="64px" height="64px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Cleanliness is godliness**

Take a steam bath ten times in the bathhouse. There are two saunas in the game - in Strizhinsk (a visit costs 150 coins plus it must first be repaired by completing the appropriate quest) and in Roadside (it will cost only 100 coins per session and is available from the very beginning). The effect of the visit is the same - all heroines get + 10% to hits and mana for the next 1000 steps. The fastest way to achieve this is by accumulating a thousand coins and arriving in Roadside: save, steam up ten times, and reload. The achievement is earned, and your money remains intact.
