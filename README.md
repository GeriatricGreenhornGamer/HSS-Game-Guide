# Introduction

This guide is intended to provide useful information on achievments and the thornier quests for the game [Heroines of Swords & Spells](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1212400/Heroines_of_Swords__Spells/). This guide has two parts: an achievement guide that translate and builds upon [Sam Newberry's achievement guide in Russian](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038447122); and a walkthrough for certain byzantine parts of the game. A more complete walkthrough may come later.

The guide is intended to crowd source information for corrections and additions. Please feel free to make edits and submit pull requests to the [github repo](https://github.com/GeriatricGreenhornGamer/HSS-Game-Guide/) for this website.
